## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I learned:

- How to create a responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- How to make interactive elements with minimal JavaScript.
- Techniques for enhancing the user experience on various devices.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Add more interactivity to the component, such as animating the share options.
- Improve accessibility by ensuring better keyboard navigation.
- Optimize the component for more advanced responsiveness, such as adding animations for mobile interactions.
